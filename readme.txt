== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How I can send you a translation? =

Send me the translated .mo file to migueluseche(a)skatox.com and indicate the language, I can read english or spanish,
so please write me on these languages.

= Can I use images as bullets or trigger symbols? =

Yes, select 'Empty Space' as trigger symbol and Save, then you can add any custom background using CSS
to 'jaw_symbol' class or 'jaw_symbol' and 'expanded' for expanded items.

= Can I show this list inside posts? =

Yes, only write [jQuery Archive List] anywhere inside a post or page's contest and it will be replaced for
the archive list when rendering the content.

= How I contribute to this plugin? =

By using it, recommending it to other users, giving it 5 starts at this plugin's wordpress page, suggesting features
or coding new features and finally by DONATING using this plugin's website donate link.

= How can i add multiples instances? =

Since 1.1 there's a trick to do it, just add a new Text widget only with  [jQuery Archive List] as content (without quotes) then
when looking the site it will have a new copy of the widget. Due to plugin architecture, there's no way to have
a single configuration for each instance (but you can edit source code and register and copy  widget functions to implement this).

== Screenshots ==

1. Here you can see a list of the archives, archives for each month are hidden under years.
2.  Here you can see a list of archives and its month archives expanded.
