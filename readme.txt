1. Upload all downloaded files to /wp-content/plugins/jquery-archive-list-widget/
1. Activate plugin at the plugins section.

* Title: title of the widget.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why this plugin is not working? =

By support experience, like 99% of problems are due to: 
* There's a Javascript error caused by other plugin and it stops any further code execution, check your browser's logs to find the problem and deactivate the conflict plugin.
* Your template doesn't have a wp_footer() function, this plugin requires this function to load JS code at the end of the website to improve speed.

= How I can send you a translation? =

Send me the translated .mo file to migueluseche(a)skatox.com and indicate the language, I can read english or spanish,
so please write me on these languages.

= Can I use images as bullets or trigger symbols? =

Yes, select 'Empty Space' as trigger symbol and Save, then you can add any custom background using CSS, 
just play with the widget's classes .jaw_symbol, .jaw_years, .jaw_months.


= Can I show this list inside posts? =

Yes, only write [jQuery Archive List] anywhere inside a post or page's contest and it will be replaced for
the archive list when rendering the content.

= How I contribute to this plugin? =

By using it, recommending it to other users, giving it 5 starts at plugin's wordpress page, suggesting features
or coding new features and finally by DONATING using plugin's website's donate link.

= How can i add multiples instances? =

Since 1.1 there's a trick to do it, just add a new Text widget only with  [jQuery Archive List] as content (without quotes) then
when looking the site it will have a new copy of the widget. Due to the plugin architecture, there's no way to have
a single configuration for each instance (but you can edit source code and register and copy  widget functions to implement this).

== Screenshots ==

1. Here you can see a list of the archives, archives for each month are hidden under years.
2.  Here you can see a list of archives and its month archives expanded.
